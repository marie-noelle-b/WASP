# WASP
Turbulent fluxes parameterization - developped for SURFEX

This is the first version of the WASP code. It provides a "bulk" algorithm to represent turbulent fluxes at the air-sea interface in the SURFEX format. SURFEX (https://www.umr-cnrm.fr/surfex/) is the surface module common to the Meteo-France atmospheric models, which can be used to coupled atmospheric models with oceanic or wave models.
WASP (Wage-Age dependent Stress Parameterization) has been written to provide a parameterization suitable for wind-wave coupling (i.e. taking into account the variation of the surface roughness induced by the growth of waves) and fitted to available observations.
